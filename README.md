# Bilkent Course Scheduler
Interactive course scheduler for Bilkent University

Since IEEE scheduler is down, why not create a new one?

Disclaimer: Build this in 2 weeks with zero prior react/html/css knowledge. I just wanted to make it work and didn't do any optimization on front-end. I didn't clean up the css at all and there may be unused variables dangling. If you want to clean the code please do so. Please don't curse at me if you become blind from ugliness of the code, you have been warned.
