Since IEEE scheduler is down, why not create a new one?

### Installation

You do not need to install this to use it. Soon I will upload it to a proper website. If you want to contribute or run it locally, you need to install some libraries.

First get [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
(Optional) Get [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Babel JS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You need to install [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/help/) as well.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
